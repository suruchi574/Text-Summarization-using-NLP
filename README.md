## Description

Text summarization is the process of creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary of a longer text document. It is the process of distilling the most important information from a source text. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Automatic text summarization methods are greatly needed to address the ever-growing amount of text data available online to both better help discover relevant information and to consume relevant information faster.
